* This is my second work on Processing, 2048 clone.
* It took a long time, almost 6 hours. Also, my code is not clean and smart.
* But it works!
* I tried to use it on Processing.js, but it does not work well.
* You can download Mac, Windows, Linux version from <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-t3HBYq7YB4WWthUTJGZFVnODQ">here</a>. 
* Enjoy!
